## 🔧 Customization

### Modify Time Settings
Edit `generate_schedule_cli_copy.py`:
```python
# Working hours
earliest_start = 9 * 60  # 09:00
latest_start = 18 * 60   # 18:00

# Daily limits
min_day = 30    # Minimum 30 minutes
max_day = 120   # Maximum 120 minutes

# Time units
unit = 30       # 30-minute blocks
```

### Modify Export Formats
The GUI allows you to select which formats to export:
- Check/uncheck the export options
- All formats use the same schedule data
- Files are saved in the current directory

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Import Error**: Make sure all files are in the same directory
2. **GUI Not Opening**: Check if tkinter is installed
3. **Export Errors**: Ensure write permissions in the current directory
4. **Invalid Date**: Use YYYY-MM-DD format

### Error Messages
- "Weekly hours cannot exceed 15" - Reduce your hours input
- "Total weekly minutes must be at least 30" - Increase your hours input
- "Duration too long" - The time slot doesn't fit in working hours
